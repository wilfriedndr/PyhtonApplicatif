Using the PyQt5 library, write a calculator app that :
- has a keypad with all digits (0 - 9)
- can perform basic mathematical operations ( + - * / )
- displays the result to the user
- can clear the input or result


Bonus:
Bonus points will only be attributed if all the basic features above were developped.
Here are some you can think of:
- More complex mathematical operations
- Calculation history
- A nice custom UI
- Plotting with Matplotlib
- ...
