Using the PyQt5 library, write a a to do list app.
Todos have a title (and a state "done" or "not done")

Your to do list app should have at least these features:

- creating a new to do
- listing all current todos
- checking a to do (changing the state)
- removing a to do
- persistent to dos (when closing and opening the app again, todos previsouly entered should still be there)

Bonus:
Bonus points will only be attributed if all the basic features above were developped.
Here are some you can think of:
- todo date attribute
- todos lists (e.g "work todos", "personal todos", "school" ...)
- A nice custom UI
- password protection of the app
- ...
